# DeUber
 
DeUber is a management software used to track and optimize vehicle routes on package delivery kind situations. It aims to give optimal routes over planned goal circuits and random event circuits. 

Its main goal is to be able to be a highly customizable, easy to use software which a bunch of built-in algorithms prepared for the user to solve the problem the way he wishes to. 

1. [Installation](#installation)
2. [Documentation]()
3. [Version Management](#version-management)

## Installation

If we want to run the program, we will copy the exe and dll from the bin folder to the destination desired. 

> The dll's should always be in the same folder as the exe.

## Documentation

The documentation of the project is located on the doc folder


## Version Management

 The actual version is:
 > Pre V1.0

###  CheckList for V1.0

- [x] Responsive command line interface.
- [x] Non random map generation tool.
- [x] Customizable initial menu.
- [x] BFS for path finding.
- [x] Survive

###  CheckList for V2.0

**DeUber**

- [ ] Reorganize the data/res folders
- [ ] Ability to pause the simulation
- [ ] Create the environments on Gym
- [ ] Implement the first Neural Network
- [ ] Link Tensorflow C++ to execute the Neural Network from C++
- [ ] Improved assets
- [ ] Custom Algorithm for finding optimal path

All the other libraries are implemented in their own GitHub repositories, but since we need some features for DeUber to be fulfilled, we will add the checklist in this readme.

**CWman**

- [ ] Implement BorderLayout
- [ ] Write documentation about the library
- [ ] Study whether threading is a viable solution or an inefficient one.

**TGMotor**

- [ ] Write documentation about the library
- [ ] Improve the default asset loading system
- [ ] Improve the GameMap class to support the 2d grid map


### Optional CheckList

- [ ] Improve the argument system to something similar to argparse
- [ ] Improve the installation process
